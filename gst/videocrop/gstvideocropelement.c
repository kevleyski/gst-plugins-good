/**
 * SECTION:element-videocrop
 * @title: videocrop
 * @see_also: #GstVideoBox
 *
 * This element crops video frames, meaning it can remove parts of the
 * picture on the left, right, top or bottom of the picture and output
 * a smaller picture than the input picture, with the unwanted parts at the
 * border removed.
 *
 * The videocrop element is similar to the videobox element, but its main
 * goal is to support a multitude of formats as efficiently as possible.
 * Unlike videbox, it cannot add borders to the picture and unlike videbox
 * it will always output images in exactly the same format as the input image.
 *
 * If there is nothing to crop, the element will operate in pass-through mode.
 *
 * Note that no special efforts are made to handle chroma-subsampled formats
 * in the case of odd-valued cropping and compensate for sub-unit chroma plane
 * shifts for such formats in the case where the #GstVideoCrop:left or
 * #GstVideoCrop:top property is set to an odd number. This doesn't matter for
 * most use cases, but it might matter for yours.
 *
 * ## Example launch line
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 -v videotestsrc ! videocrop top=42 left=1 right=4 bottom=0 ! ximagesink
 * ]|
 *

/* TODO:
 *  - for packed formats, we could avoid memcpy() in case crop_left
 *    and crop_right are 0 and just create a sub-buffer of the input
 *    buffer
